<b>Group members:</b> Arka Mitra, Puja Roy, Dongwei Fu <b>

<b>Our goal is to train a neural network model to predict MODIS monthly cloud properties based on NOAA NCEP Reanalysis data. <br>

<b>Notebooks:</b><br>
Project6_NN_MOD08.ipynb - Generic Notebook to data processing, NN model training and CTH prediction results. <br>

<b>Data:</b><br>
NCEP Reanalysis Data were retrieved from this FTP site: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/thredds/catalog/Datasets/catalog.html/ <br>
MODIS Level 3 Monthly mean data at 1 degree grid (MOD08) are available at: https://earthdata.nasa.gov/ <br>

NCEP Reanalysis data at 2.5 degree grid were resampled to 1 degree.
